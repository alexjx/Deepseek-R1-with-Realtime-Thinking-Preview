# Deepseek R1 Manifold Pipe with Real-Time Thinking

**Adapted code from CoppingEthan**

- Add time tracking for the thinking process of Deepseek R1.
- Make the think block collaspable.
- Adapted none-deepseek services.

**Adapted code from MCode-Team to add realtime preview of the thinking process for Deepseek R1 and Deepseek Chat.**

I would like to thank the original author, MCode-Team, for sharing this code. This project builds upon their work and I hope it serves as a helpful modification.
